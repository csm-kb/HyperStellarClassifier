# TO-DO List
- [ ] Improve input stage by randomly jittering some of the inputs (rotation, vflip, hflip, scale)
- [ ] Investigate what any regularizers on the various layers will do to the test/train/validate stages
- [ ] Explore additional CNN layer architectures to see if we can improve performance
