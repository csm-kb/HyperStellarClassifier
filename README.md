Project Name: Stellar Classifier

Problem Statement: Telescopes and satellites obtain huge amounts of data every moment and that data needs to be processed. For decades, people did the processing and classification of images and information by hand. Over time, there have been several competitions on developing machine learning algorithms that can perform the data processing in the shortest time with the least amount of error. 

Proposed Solution: Find the best-performing machine learning model among a variety of image classification models that yields the lowest RMSE score upon training and validation, using TensorFlow and Keras. The model to tune is the convolutional neural network, considered by most professionals to be one of the most accurate image classification models to date. Hyperparameters to tune include layer size and layout, activation functions, kernel regularizer, and optimization and loss functions.
